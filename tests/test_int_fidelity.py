"""Integer quantities must stay exact integers.

Line-wide invariant, asserted per repo because the helper is vendored per repo.
It exists because of a live defect in proxy-aiops (Traefik route priority is an
int64; routing it through the float helper collapsed two *different*
priorities — …806 and …805 — onto the same displayed value). A 2026-08-02 sweep
found that only proxy-aiops had actually been fixed: five other ``as_int``
implementations, this one included, still round-tripped integers through
float64, which cannot represent values above 2**53 exactly.

The bool case is not pedantry: ``bool`` subclasses ``int``, so an int
short-circuit placed before a bool guard would return ``True`` unchanged and
serialise it as ``true`` instead of a number.
