"""Test isolation: redirect the governance harness state at a tmp dir.

Governed-tool calls write an audit row (and, for reversible writes, an undo
token). This autouse fixture points ``QUEUE_AIOPS_HOME`` at a throwaway
directory and resets the harness singletons so nothing touches the real
``~/.queue-aiops`` during tests.
